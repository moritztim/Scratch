## Customizable Project-Specific Settings
> Unless you know what you're doing, only edit this section (marked by ===) in the `Makefile`.[^1]
> If you do know what you're doing, consider making a fork of the template!

### Metadata

#### `NAME` = `Project`
The name of your project or sprite. This will be used to name the output file in the `bin/` directory.

Spaces are allowed.

#### `TYPE` = `project`
Must be either `project`[^2] or `sprite`[^3], in lowercase.

#### `PROJECT_ID`: Numerical project ID on the Scratch website

This can be found in the URLs related to the project. For example: <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1105131011/editor" target="_blank"> https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/`1105131011`/editor</a>
If the project is not "shared", you need to be logged in as the author to see it.
If other users find your project ID, they will not be able to tell that there even is a project with this ID unless you have "shared" it. [^4]

### Project Structure

This section reflects your project's directory structure. If you modify the values, make sure your actual directories match these names, and vice versa. These paths are relative to the place from where you run the `make` commands.

If you want to point to subdirectories, use `/` to separate them, for example: `directory/subdirectory`. Do not include a leading `/` or `./` or a trailing `/`.
#### `SRC_DIR` = `src`
Where the source files are stored. This is where your `project.json` or `sprite.json` file will be.

#### `ASSETS_DIR` = `assets`
Where the asset files, i.e. sounds and costumes are stored.[^5].

#### `OUT_DIR` = `bin`
Where the output files are stored. This is where the final scratch file[^6] will be created.

## Scratch File Format
This is based on the external specification of the Scratch file format[^7].

### `OUT_FILE_LOCATION` = `$(OUT_DIR)`
This is the directory where the final scratch file[^6] will be created. If you want it to be directly in the project root, set it to `.`. If you change this to be outside of the [`OUT_DIR`](#out_dir), make sure to add your custom location to the `.gitignore` file, so that it doesn't get committed to the repository. If there are other files in this directory, that you do want in your repository, you need to add the exact file path to the `.gitignore` file, as defined by [`ZIP_FILE`](#zip_file).

#### `ZIP_ASSETS_DIR` = `$(OUT_DIR)/assets`
Where the asset files are stored after building the project. This is where the final asset files will be copied to. This will be reflected in the final scratch file[^6].

#### `ZIP_JSON_FILE` = `$(TYPE).json`
Base name of the JSON file that will be created in the `$(OUT_DIR)` directory. It will be named `project.json` or `sprite.json` depending on the value of `TYPE`.

#### `ZIP_FILE_EXTENSION` â‰ˆ `sb3` or `sprite3`
The file extension of the final Scratch file[^6]. This changes depending on the value of `TYPE`: `sb3`[^7] for `project`s and `sprite3`[^8] for `sprite`s.

#### `ZIP_FILE` = `$(OUT_DIR)/$(NAME).$(ZIP_FILE_EXTENSION)`
The path (including the file name) of the final scratch file[^6].

#### `SCRATCH_BASE_URL` = `https://scratch.mit.edu`
The base URL of the Scratch website. This is used for the `open` target.

#### `OPEN_COMMAND` = `xdg-open`
The command used to open the project in the browser. This can be any command that takes a URL as its only argument.
